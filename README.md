# The Departed Text Generator

This is the code for a website that generates a few random paragraphs of text. THe text is drawn from the screenplay of _The Departed (2006)_.

It is meant as a replacement for traditional Lorem Ipsum placeholder text. However I have found that it generally causes confusion and paranoia when used for this purpose. The text it produces is very offensive. YMMV. 

> Warning: Contains and may display violent, foul and racist language, unfiltered from the original screenplay. Not suitable for children.
