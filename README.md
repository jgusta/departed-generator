# The Departed Text Generator

This is the code for a website that generates a few random paragraphs of text. The text is drawn from the screenplay of _The Departed (2006)_.

After some personal tests I've decided to clean up the language a bit and omit some lines to make this more usable.

> Warning: Contains and may display violent, foul and racist language from the original screenplay. Not suitable for children.
