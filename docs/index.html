And by organized crime in this city, you know who we mean. That's Jackie Costigan. That's an old picture. Jackie met his demise. Last known photograph. Costello uses three key guys. That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho, lives in Brockton with his mother. She's straight out of Going My Way. Delahunt, muscle. French, the number one. But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.

      "Are you still a cop?",
      "No, I ain't.",

      "A decision.",
      "Do they know about me?",

Must have been a big fucking dog, man. I spent all fucking night doing it, man. I'm embarrassed. I still don't believe he was a cop. I don't believe it.",

      "Where's Dignam? I told you to bring Dignam!",
      "Yeah. Everybody's fucking numbers. Is there something that you just wanna go ahead and ask me? Because I'll give you the fucking answer, all right? Frank, look at me. Look at me. I'm not the fucking rat. Okay? I'm not the fucking rat.",
      "Put Colin on the phone right now.",
      "Yeah, it was in the papers.",
      "Let's say you have no idea and leave it at that, okay? No idea. Zip. None. If you had an idea what we do, we would not be good at what we do, would we? We would be cunts. Are you calling us cunts?",
      "What about the baby?",
      "If this is such a fucking bad idea why'd you show up?",

      "Hey, hey!",
      "What's this?",
      "More than one. He's one of Costello's.",
      "Should I?",
      "Every weekend, sergeant.",
      "Queenan's guy. He called when he found out Queenan died. I'm running him.",
      "We won't be working together, that is, directly. You'll be working for Captain Ellerby, but I like to see everybody. You're a worker. You rise fast.",
      "Uncle Jackie was excellent. Fucking guineas.",
      "Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son. I knew Myles. He was younger than me, but he was behind me in school. I wanna get these people who did this to him. Would you like to help us? You wanna help catch the people who forced your son to do a robbery and then killed him?",
      "Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?",
      "All right, lookit, I know you're a worker. Maybe I can do something for you. You got any suits, or do you like coming to work dressed like you're gonna invade Poland?",
      "Did you fucking see that?",
      "That Irish pissant he's so hot for me, we give him a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it. Let's give him a whiff.",
      "See you later.",

      "Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them.",
      "You see, that's my point, you know? You accuse me once, I put up with it. You accuse me twice I quit. You pressure me to fear for my life and I will put a fucking bullet in your head as if you were anybody else. Okay?",
      "Really?",
      "Go ahead, Fitz.",
      "You always have to question everything, don't you?",
      "Shut up! Work with the tech guys to unlock those files.",
      "Did you put a camera in the back? Can I talk to you for a second, please?",
      "Okay, my people are out there. They're like fucking Indians. You're not gonna see them. You'll hear about them through me or Captain Queenan. You will not ever know the identity of undercover people. Unfortunately, this shithole has more leaks than the Iraqi navy.",
      "Vin, don't make me have to come down here again for this.",
      "Make more money.",
      "Before I went to fucking Suffolk.",
      "Arm.",

      "This is unbelievable. Who put the cameras in this place?",
      "Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain anything to anybody! I can fucking investigate anybody I want to!",
      "You my attorney?",
      "The Knights of Columbus were real head-breakers. True guineas. They took over their piece of the city. Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get a fucking job we had the presidency. May he rest in peace. That's what the n****s don't realize. If I got one thing against the black chappies, it's this: No one gives it to you. You have to take it.",
      "You can get out of here. I'm using a new crew tonight. New guys.",
      "You a psychiatrist?",
      "Shut your fucking mouth. Come on, get up!",
      "I brought your mother some pictures of my father.",
      "We're not here to solve the case of the missing scumbag. We're here to nail Costello.",
      "Yeah. I'm not sitting herewithout a tetanus shot.",
      "Are you sure it's me? Not all that talk about whiffing and crawling up asses?",
      "Well, a better question, is why the fuck were your guys following him?",
      "Ten. Ten million.",
      "Have I seen you professionally?",
      "Frank?",
      "You're telling me, sonny boy.",
      "All that murdering and fucking, and no sons.",
      "I tried to call you a few times.",
      "Company?",
      "You know, after my mother passed and everything. In your line of work, if I gave you like, what, say, 10,000, what could I get back?",
      "We have a blind spot.",
      "That's part of what I do. I normally don't see cadets who've been kicked out of the academy.",
      "Hey, now, why do you work for the state?",
      "Sarge, we got the target coming out.",
      "Thanks.",

      "Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?",
      "I'm tired from fucking your wife.",
      "I gotta go to work.",
      "A cranberry juice.",
      "Why do you do it, then? Some people do get better. Fair enough. Sometimes I want people to forget their personal bullshit and do their jobs.",
      "Says who?",
      "Sir, yes, sir!",
      "We all are. Act accordingly.",
      "Get out of here. Get out of here!",
      "What is this, a citizen's arrest? Blow me, all right?",
      "I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.",
      "I mean, nothing? Like, I mean, anything that could help us.",
      "Oh, I know, I know. I know.",
      "Move out! Go on!",
      "That'd stick.",
      "You got that?",
      "What do you expect coming in here?",
      "We're getting a warrant. Can't get an address off him. He paged his lawyer but the lawyer hasn't called back yet.",
      "A decision. And, you know, you have to stick by what you choose.",
      "Oh, boy. You should get a better job, huh?",
      "Jimmy had a rough month. Jimmy had a heart attack in jail, and then he got himself knifed at Boston City Hospital. I believe it's been in the papers.",
      "Was that that shrink cunt that answered the phone?",
      "Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.",
      "My mother had them. My... My mother's dead.",
      "All right, look. We got a guy says Costello's moving the processors to China. He set up the whole fucking job and popped Kennefick. You do not want to miss it if Costello takes a dump.",
      "I told Internal Investigations to follow Captain Queenan.",
      "All right. I got him.",
      "His real name Mr. French?",
      "What are you gonna do about Costello's rat in this building?",
      "You know, direct contact with your guys would have its advantages.",
      "Don't worry about it. The guy don't need any fucking teeth anyway.",
      "So you moving out or you moving in?",
      "Why did they turn their phones off?",
      "Yeah, that's true. I said something fucking true. I want some fucking pills and you're gonna close my file?",
      "That's me.",
      "Yeah. Hey, can I lookit?",
      "Are you a statie?",
      "Would you shoot this fucking prick!",
      "I'm gonna have my associate search you.",
      "You're gonna give me shit? It wasn't for no reason, Frank. He reached into his coat. I don't know if he's a bookie or what he's doing.",
      "Load it.",
      "Proceed.",
      "You keep telling me I'm your friend. You don't even know my fucking name.",
      "Hawthorne.",
      "No.",
      "Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry.",
      "Hey, you wanna see some dead guys? Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby on the 6:00 news.",
      "What, so you can get the parade, huh? The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you! Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!",
      "Well, I expect that some people do it to keep things on an even keel.",
      "Get rid of this. French. Put it downstairs. Here.",
      "Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.",
      "Queenan had a funeral to go to. This is my shift. Calm down.",
      "Two pills? Why don't you just give me a bottle of Scotch and a handgun to blow my fucking head off?",
      "Hi, Captain",
      "Fuck this.",
      "Give them up to the Almighty.",
      "You don't have much family.",
      "I'm saying he worked at the airport.",
      "I know.",
      "Let's go. Now.",
      "I don't crack up.",
      "Says him. Says Costello. God says, as far as you're... concerned.",
      "Know what I'm saying?",
      "Listen, Bill, I gotta run this in the other room. This computer's getting all frigging blooey on me. Give me two minutes. I'll have you out of here in no time.",
      "Detail. Half left. Face. Prepare to fire. Fire. Prepare to fire. Fire. Prepare to fire. Fire. Detail. Half right. Face.",
      "They're compromised.",
      "Where's your boy?",
      "I don't care. I'd rather hand in my papers first.",
      "Won't happen again, Mr. C.",
      "If you're not being run by us, you're being run by someone else. That means you're bringing undesirable elements into Mr. Costello's area.",
      "Allegedly.",
      "Come to my store next Friday. I'll give you the money.",
      "Yeah. Sure.",
      "Carmen's developing into a fine young lady. You should be proud. You get your period yet, Carmen?",
      "Look, I'm having panic attacks. Other night, I thought I was having a heart attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over. I haven't slept for fucking weeks.",
      "It's a fucking result.",
      "Of course I talk to the FBI.",
      "Oh, good to see you. Come on in.",
      "And what if that was a legitimate threat? Think about it, fucking hotshot.",
      "Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.",
      "As I remember, she ain't that sentimental. That was quick.",
      "Thank you.",
      "A guy comes in here against every instinct of privacy, of self-reliance that he has and what do you do? What do you do? You send him off on the street to score smack? Is that what you do?",
      "Mr. Costello.",
      "Time is 10:46.",
      "Yeah, that's my cousin.",
      "Who told you I had delicate sensibilities? I just don't like it, sarge. Don't feel right.",
      "Yes.",
      "Sir, yes, sir!",
      "Yeah? So?",
      "Just act professional.",
      "Shut the fuck up!",
      "I don't get it.",
      "I need the identity of your undercovers.",
      "Yeah, who wants to know?",
      "Why, does that make you uncomfortable?",
      "Smart-mouth. Too bad. If you'll indulge me... Now what?",
      "When's the last time you checked?",
      "All right, run the last number he called. That's his house. I'll swear to the judge I surveilled him there and abra-fucking-cadabra, we got a warrant.",
      "I didn't say I'd close your file. No, I...",
      "Do you trust him?",
      "Who are you?",
      "The readiness is all. You know the players. Call the game.",
      "Business is bad? You opened a store in an Irish neighborhood. These are dirty people. Don't you know that? Sell potatoes, I don't know what you're gonna do.",
      "I've still got three weeks left on the lease.",
      "So he never...? I mean, never?",
      "Just fucking kill me. Just fucking kill me.",
      "If I wasn't with the Massachusetts State Police if I did it full-time, law school I'd be through it in a year. If I wasn't a trooper. But another city. I was thinking that. Another city.",
      "If we had some Homeland Security money like some douche bags I could mention...",
      "Here's some ice water.",
      "Fuck yourself.",
      "I know. I know. I'm not... I'm not here for that, okay? I'm not. Listen. I've gotta give you something. Something I need you to keep. For me. Okay?",
      "Myles Kennefick. Got the job with a forged UMass transcript. UMass, Boston which happens to...",
      "I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back again like last week.",
      "Hey! Put the fucking gun down!",
      "What was his name, the departed?",
      "Get you? Give you? Who the fuck do you work for?",
      "Camera's off. It's off. Call your mother.",
      "I was dreaming I was dead.",
      "Where?",
      "He's got dope coming in. I don't know where. He's getting spooky, captain.",
      "You remember that. What a night.",
      "Why do we have a blind spot?",
      "Yeah.",
      "Not to my guy.",
      "Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.",
      "What's wrong with this fucking country? Everybody hates everybody!",
      "Jimmy Pappas.",
      "They didn't figure we had a navy.",
      "Billy, I don't have a tail.",
      "Hi, Darlene.",
      "What?",
      "The buyers are there.",
      "So why do you make as much as a guidance counselor?",
      "He's one of yours. Inside. Have you seen anything?",
      "Well, I'm going home, all right? He's playing with his new guys. See you later, all right?",
      "Shoot this motherfucker! Would you fucking shoot!",
      "Well, I thought you were. So now you gotta buy me dinner.",
      "Hey. Where are you?",
      "No, no, no. That was a guy who works for me.",
      "You got to get out of here! Take the fire escape.",
      "What about you?",
      "Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas.",
      "I got it from an undercover. He knows he's being followed. So let the UC take him in.",
      "I was going for my fucking cigarettes!",
      "I have a co-signer.",
      "Well, you do know what a bookie does, don't you?",
      "Come on, man. Oh, come on, you fucking moron. Come on.",
      "Thank you, sergeant.",
      "And let perpetual light shine upon him.",
      "I probably could be you. Yeah. Yeah, I know that much. But I don't wanna be you, Frank. I don't wanna be you.",
      "Remember I told you that we were… She was gonna move in?",
      "I mean, no offense.",
      "What do you expect? Everybody knows you've been assigned here to find Costello's rat. They want to find the leak as much as you do.",
      "Yeah, sure, he was the president before Lincoln.",
      "Gwen?",
      "Calm down. Most people do it every day. What's the big deal?",
      "What would you do if he was standing right there and he saw us?",
      "What? What?",
      "Hi, pup.",
      "I got him! I got Costello here!",
      "All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank. All right. I'm sorry. If you could, please. What I need are SS numbers, DOBs. just all the pedigree information so I can run it on my end and we can ID the prick. If you can get me that information I can... We're gonna handle it. I can handle it.",
      "What's this?",
      "No.",
      "Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!",
      "I called you. You specifically. Look: You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot. I told you to meet me downstairs.",
      "Those fucking firefighters are a bunch of homos. They are.",
      "I have reason to believe that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat. So just follow him and don't get made.",
      "You don't know the half of it. I'll arrest you right now.",
      "Microprocessors. Oh, yeah. I heard the story. You arrested some Chinese government guys at the border carrying some light sockets or something.",
      "Sorry to get you last-minute, but things leak. This lead came from Queenan's undercover guy.",
      "Yes. And what he's doing. Get rid of the tail, get Special Ops on standby. We'll take this prick tonight.",
      "Get off at the next stop, all right? outh Station. You wait there 10 minutes.",
      "I think you are a cop, my son.",
      "You know, and too damn bad if you don't like my initial clinical reaction.",
      "What are you saying?",
      "I just saw him. He had blood on his hands. He's lost his fucking mind. I don't know what we're doing here, boys. He's not including his regular guys. But I'll tell you something. Sooner or later he's gonna find out who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me. I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me!",
      "Good.",
      "What you got, staff sergeant?",
      "You know, past days, situation like this, I kill everybody. Everybody who works for me.",
      "So it is you. Well, thank God you're all right. We were very worried.",
      "Hey! Hey!",
      "Ah, Christ, it's too late. Let's go back up.",
      "If you could've, you would've. But I guess you like to go at your own pace. Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.",
      "32X to CP. We're being fired upon! An officer is down. I repeat, an officer is down. A trooper's been shot! Send some back...",
      "Frank, how do you know you don't have a tail, huh?",
      "Francis.",
      "Sarge, we gotta get him out of here. Those guys aren't fucking around.",
      "What did I just put myself through? I'm out of here.",
      "Yeah, you lie. You lie. Is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally or, what, just for the fuck of it?",
      "You erased me, huh?",
      "Mom, I'm not gonna make it home for supper. Sorry, yeah, I got held up. Yeah, no, you carry on without me. I'll talk to you later. Okay. Bye.",
      "My word against yours.",
      "Thank you.",
      "Frank got shot.",
      "Go ahead, thank you. Maybe we could work something out.",
      "That's right, I see violent offenders.",
      "Ah.",
      "Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone.",
      'What, are you fucking retarded or something? That ain\'t fucking right. Are you kidding me? Look at this. Look. "Citizens." Look.',
      "Too bad. Your mother worked all goddamn day. We'll just have to sit down without you and your friends.",
      "A state-police detective. And are you a married state-police detective?",
      "Well, I knew his father. I liked his Uncle Jackie better.",
      "Cocksuckers. Motherfucking shit! Motherfucking! Back the fuck up!",
      "Yeah.",
      "Keep an eye on this one.",
      "World needs plenty of bartenders. Two weeks with pay.",
      "Another county heard from.",
      "I'm all done being a cop, all right? I just want my money and I wanna go home.",
      "Follow Costello. You'll find his rat. You're gonna be looking at my people going through their bank statements, their phone calls and medical records. Don't be surprised if they don't buy you a beer or invite you into their homes. Let me get you a coffee.",
      "Something came off the fucking roof.",
      "Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread, couple half-gallons of milk. Do you like bologna and cheese? Give him some cold cuts. Throw some mayo in You like comic books? You do good in school?",
      "Now what you gonna do?",
      "I don't give a fuck about Dignam.",
      "Is that what you wanna hear about? Did something happen to you?",
      "I hope you're not turning into one of them sob sisters wants to get caught. You're not cracking up, are you?",
      "Excuse me for one second. You know if your father were alive and saw you here sitting with me let's say he'd have a word with me about this. In fact, he'd kill seven guys just to cut my throat. And he could do it, which is maybe something you don't know about William Costigan Sr.",
      "Who are you?",
      "You earned it. No more pencils, no more books.",
      "What do you want?",
      "What about this guy?",
      "No. You want those codes.",
      "Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants. I'll get you the records and whatnot. But listen to me, son. Don't disappoint me on this or some other guy will be putting their fat cock up Little Miss Freud's ass.",
      "Oh, thanks. Thanks.",
      "Yeah, he must be our guy.",
      "Nobody calls me a liar!",
      "Well, you know what Freud said about the Irish? Yeah, I do. Yeah, if you actually do, I'll see you again.",
      "Want a French doughnut?",
      "Get in the van!",
      "Is there a reason you would have a tail?",
      "No. Please. No.",
      "What do you mean, off the roof?",
      "No pursuit.",
      "It's lovely. You get the high ceilings, the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive. The fridge has got an alarm in it in case you have. eating issues, which is a joke. Not a very funny one. Well, there's a great view of the State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it. I mean, you move in, you're upper-class by about Tuesday. So you're a cop.",
      "If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan any time in this century they'd better shape up and show me 1 million dollars.",
      "All right.",
      "That's Internal Investigations' business.",
      "You don't have any cats.",
      "So who did the two guys from Providence?",
      "No more than I am. I know that it's a serious relationship. I know there are ups and downs. Right? People have doubts and problems. Well, not problems, but doubts.",

      "Hey. Hey, hey. Do you know me?",
      "Yeah.",
      "How about I fucking kill you, huh? How about I fucking kill you!",
      "Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. But you weren't at fucking home. So where the fuck were you?",
      "Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?",
      "It's off? You're good.",
      "Get rid of the fucking tail!",
      "Hey, he can't help you. I know what you are. I know what you are and I know what you're not. I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna help you understand something. You're no fucking cop.",

      "With everybody looking up their own ass and you looking for yourself I put my money on nobody finds nothing.",
      "Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have a sealed wiretap warrant for Costello's apartment. Don't tell anyone in our division, but tell SIU. Flush it down the pipe, see if it comes out on my end. That's what we do first. Narrow it down. Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?",
      "Another city, huh? Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.",
      "No, no, no. Today.",

      "Can you still?",
      "I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts State Police. Who the fuck are you? I erased you!",
      "Costello recorded everything. He put all the tapes in a box and kept them with his lawyer. That was his insurance. His lawyer came to me. Imagine that, you rat fuck. Costello trusted me more than anyone.",

      "Something for work.",
      "Fucking shit. Looks like Queenan's meeting with all of them.",

      "No.",
      "You Johhny Sullivan's kid?",
      "All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank. Fucking perfect. What good am I to you if you don't listen to me? What good am I if you don't listen? Queenan is compartmentalizing. He's splitting everything up. He's fucking smart. You know this. I can get the rat. You just gotta let me do it my way, Frank.",
      "I'm reliable.",
      "Wake the fuck up.",
      "By Costello's people.",
      "Frank. Frank.",
      "Have a seat, Bill.",
      "Fuck.",
      "Microprocessors. We'll probably be at war with the Chinese in 20-odd years and Costello is selling them military technology.",
      "So what do I do?",
      "Pick a place like this where any cop could see you. Jesus.",
      "This is Sergeant Sullivan. I'm taking over Queenan's unit.",
      "FBI? What the fuck you talking about, FBI?",
      "So who are you?",
      "Where's your fucking boy?",
      "Is this something I can't do personally?",
      "Yeah.",
      "You know who I am. You know who I am.",

      "Oh, my God. I'm sorry.",
      "All right. That'll be the best thing for everybody. Fair enough. I just, I can't get into your file unless I have your password.",
      "That was a joke. Come on.",
      "What's he doing, setting up IRAs?",
      "Given your nature.",
      "Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.",
      "Good, Mr. Costello. I wanna tell you, at least two of these gents have machine guns.",
      "If you lied, you would have an easier time getting what you wanted.",
      "Whoop-de-fucking-do.",
      "No. No. You have to choose. You have to make a...",
      "And what's this got to do with me?",
      "Please tell me those cars aren't empty. I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty!",
      "Some time later Did you think you were the only one he had on the inside? Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI. It's you and me now, you understand? We gotta take care of each other, you understand?",
      "We have a question. Do you wanna be a cop, or do you wanna appear to be a cop? It's an honest question. Lot of guys want to appear to be cops. Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.",
      "Wait. There's still one phone up.",
      "Okay, Francis.",
      "(Transled from Cantonese) Fuck you.",
      "What?",
      "You got something you wanna ask me?",
      "Search randomly for calls made from the area.",

      "How's Sister Mary Theresa doing? We had a tasty relationship before she took her vows.",
      "Is Your Highness gonna drop me off at confession before work, or fuck me, or what?",
      "Police confirm the body of the man found dead in the Fenway marshes yesterday is that of Timothy Delahunt, an undercover policeman for the city of Boston. This was the scene yesterday when Delahunt's body was found in the marshes near the Fenway. As for who did this or why that's something police are working on right now.",
      "Yeah, I am. I'm actually going to law school also.",
      "Yeah, really.",
      "Drop your weapon and step away from Sergeant Sullivan.",
      "Check your weapons. Fitzy's got the chicken.",

      "Who's this?",
      "Where are you? We've been trying to reach you. We found the rat. Listen, we're gonna take him out. Lookit: The address is 314 Washington Street. You got it? All right, we'll see you there.",

      "Yeah. We were classmates in the academy together.",
      "Long time. Long fucking time.",
      "No, no. No, I know who you are, though. I know. Guys gotta use their service revolver in the course of duty and then they get to come to talk to you about their feelings and whatnot. No, no, I know how it goes. You're a mental health professional.",

      "No. No, thanks.",
      "You fellas come from Providence?",
      "Nobody knows nothing.",
      "Do you need some money for the funeral?",
      "Well, families are always rising or falling in America, am I right?",
      "Tearing their internal organs, their liver, their lungs, their heart bringing tissue, bone, blood, brain matter, and that's called a blowback.",
      "SIU. What a country.",
      "I want you to know, you don't got to stay.",
      "Gwen, we lost Frank.",
      "South Boston?",
      "Who said he had a problem?",
      "All right, all right, all right. You're okay. You'll be all right. Get your hand taken care of.",

      "Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers. Pay them.",
      "Do they know who I am?",
      "That's right. You used to be a cop.",
      "Honesty is not synonymous with truth.",
      "Here, Bill, this is for you. From now on, call the bar, ask for Mikey. Just Mikey. You ask for Mikey because there is no Mikey. You wait. We'll call you.",
      "Whatever you have to say think about it real hard, all right? If you still wanna tell me, you tell me in two weeks, okay?",
      "It's pouring out there.",
      "The point I'm making with John Lennon is a man could look at anything and make something out of it. For instance I look at you and I think: What could I use you for?",
      "Eat something.",
      "Look, we need you to keep your ears open, all right? No bullshit. I think Costello's got a spy inside the Special Investigation Unit.",
      "Hey! You are killing my business, man!",
      "Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison to the undercover section. His undercover work is extensive. He's here to give us his report. Sergeant Dignam.",
      "Yeah, it's working. Overtime.",
      "See anything you like, Col?",
      "What can't you believe?",
      "Now, you also do probation work, right?",
      "That wasn't a joke. You play a tough guy, doesn't mean you are one you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!",
      "Look, he's Costello's rat, all right? I got boxes of tapes! Evidence! Other documents proving it!",
      "Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar? Just kidding. How's your mother?",
      "What happened?",
      "In the future, I tell you to do a thing, you fucking do it. You got that? I got it. Okay?",
      "Yeah, it's me.",
      "Exactly. You're nobody. You signed the papers, remember? We're the only two people on this earth that even know you're a cop. How about we just erase your file, huh? How about we erase your file and you're just another soldier for Costello open to arrest for I don't know how many felonies. What do you say?",
      "If I was, I'd ask you why you're a statie making 30 grand a year. And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud I wouldn't get an answer. Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker like you doing in the staties?",
      "School? With all due respect, Mr. Costello school is out.",
      "You get it now, do you?",
      "He is giving information to the FBI. He's a protected fucking informant. I mean, aren't they always trying to make it a federal case and it never gets made?",
      "That's it for me.",

      "He just went into a building down the waterfront. 344 Wash. You got that? 344 Wash. Yeah, he went up to the top floor. Building's empty. No tenants here.",
      "Fucking bitch! Let him go!",
      "For his own good, tell Bruce Lee and the Karate Kids none of us are carrying automatic weapons. Because here, in this country. It don't add inches to your dick. You get a life sentence for it.",
      "That's outstanding.",
      "Sarge, something just came off the building.",
      "You have to move in with your boyfriend?",
      "So what was it like for you in jail?",
      "Watch your fucking mouth.",
      "Oh, that's the movers.",
      "Death is hard. Life is much easier.",
      "Impossible.",

      "This is for you to hold. Only you. You open this if something happens to me or if I call you and I tell you to open it. You're the only person I can trust, all right? Please.",
      "Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.",
      "Hi, Dad. I got promoted. All right.",

      "So earn it. I'm getting the feeling we got a cop in my crew.",
      "Patriot Act, Patriot Act. I love it, I love it, I love it.",
      "Look, I'm sorry to even... I'm sorry to even show up here like this, you know? I... There's just no one else I could give it to. There's no one else.",
      "I'm trying to help you.",
      "Now, why would you have to remind me of that? Would I...? Would I be any good at what I do if I didn't fucking already know that? Frank, you gotta trust me. I can get the rat. You just gotta let me do it my way, Frank. Just let me do it. Let me do what I do.",
      "I don't give a fuck what you think! I got reason to believe that Queenan got killed by his fucking undercover.",
      "I thought I was on for this.",
      "Did you?",
      "Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan. I want constant surveillance on Captain Queenan, starting right now. Good. Thank you.",
      "They're what?",
      "No one's searching me.",
      "Oh, yeah?",
      "Yeah.",
      "I pay him two grand. There's no profit, I pay him two grand.",
      "That cop was tough. We were excessive with the cop.",
      "Maybe because it's always been so easy for me to get cunt that I never understood jerking off in a theater. Christ.",
      "I smell a rat. Jesus Christ.",
      "Yeah, I got that.",
      "I haven't needed the money since I took Archie's milk money in the third grade. Tell you the truth, I don't need pussy anymore, either. But I like it. Point I'm making here is, Bill I got this rat this gnawing, cheese-eating, fucking rat and it brings up questions. You know. See, Bill, like, you're the new guy. Girlfriend... Why don't you stay in the bar that night I got your numbers? Social-security numbers.",

      "Yeah, I know. I'm kind of getting that feeling too.",
      "What happened to Jimmy Pappas?",
      "Thank you.",
      "You need to call your mother... tell her you're not gonna be home for supper.",
      "Maybe you do. But right now I need you to drop the weapon!",
      "Yeah? Is it enough to commit suicide?",
      "Including the criminals?",
      'I don\'t know if this is how you spell "citizens." But fuck it, you know?',
      "Because I think...",
      "What arm? What fucking arm?",
      "Get your fucking hands off me!",
      "One of us had to die. With me it tends to be the other guy.",
      "Yeah.",
      "How the fuck did this happen?",
      "Goddamn motherfucker! Fucking kill you! Where's your fucking boy? What the fuck was that?",
      "I was at the grocery store with no signal, all right? When I got the signal, I got the call.",

      "Right now. Collie laying low is not what I do.",
      "I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan at which time he drew down on me, and I was able to squeeze off one shot and strike him in the head. At that time I immediately checked the vitals on both Troopers Brown and Costigan and discovered that they had expired. I just wanna go on record. I'm recommending William Costigan for the Medal of Merit.",

You, however, grew up on the North Shore, huh? Well, la-di-fucking-da. You were kind of a double kid, I bet, right? One kid with your old man, one kid with your mother. You're upper-middle class during the weeks, then you're hanging in the Southie projects with your daddy, the fucking donkey on the weekends. I got that right? Yup. You have different accents? You did, didn't you, you little fucking snake? You were like different people.",
