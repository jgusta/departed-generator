  "I hope you're not turning into one of them sob sisters wants to get caught. You're not cracking up, are you?",
  "I just said he had a f**king problem. There's a man could've been anything.",
  "I just saw him. He had blood on his hands. He's lost his f**king mind. I don't know what we're doing here, boys. He's not including his regular guys. But I'll tell you something. Sooner or later he's gonna find out who I am and he's gonna f**king kill me. I know it. He's gonna f**king kill me!",

  "I smell a rat. Jesus Christ.",
  "I spent all f**king night dragging the poor bastard in there. Tell me how they found him so fast. Somebody walking a f**king dog in three feet of mud? What kind of f**king size of dog is that? Must have been a big f**king dog, man. I spent all f**king night doing it, man. I'm embarrassed. I still don't believe he was a cop. I don't believe it.",
  "I tell you, Mr. Costello I'd like to squeeze some f**king money out of it.",

  "I'm gonna get you.",
  "I'm gonna have my associate search you.",

  "I'm saying he worked at the airport.",
  "I'm set without your own personal job application, sergeant.",
  "I'm sorry. Sorry for your troubles. I was at a funeral myself, man. Myles Kennefick. Knew him in school. He was a young guy, you know? It's terrible. It's a shame.",
  "I'm sure of that.",
  "I'm taking him downstairs now.",
  "I'm the guy who does his job. You must be the other guy.",

  "I... You know, I have... I...",
  "If I was, I'd ask you why you're a statie making 30 grand a year. And I think if I was Sigmund f**king Freud I wouldn't get an answer. Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherf**ker like you doing in the staties?",
  "If I wasn't with the Massachusetts State Police if I did it full-time, law school I'd be through it in a year. If I wasn't a trooper. But another city. I was thinking that. Another city.",
  "If he was killed, he probably did something wrong. But not the robbery. That's not wrong. He did something else wrong?",
  "If he's not paying attention to us, he's a cop. Lookit. You see that guy over there? Right over there.",
  "If they don't do their jobs, you don't have one.",
  "If this is such a f**king bad idea why'd you show up?",
  "If we had some Homeland Security money like some douche bags I could mention...",
  "If you could've, you would've. But I guess you like to go at your own pace. Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.",
  "If you lied, you would have an easier time getting what you wanted.",
  "If you're not being run by us, you're being run by someone else. That means you're bringing undesirable elements into Mr. Costello's area.",
  "Impossible.",
  "In no time you made sergeant.",
  "In the future, I tell you to do a thing, you f**king do it. You got that? I got it. Okay?",
  "In the trunk or the glove compartment?",
  "Including the criminals?",
  "Is Your Highness gonna drop me off at confession before work, or f**k me, or what?",
  "Is he a headcase like me? I'm just curious.",
  "Is it real?",
  "Is that true?",
  "Is that understood?",
  "Is that what you wanna hear about? Did something happen to you?",
  "Is there a reason you would have a tail?",
  "Is this something I can't do personally?",
  "It ain't Bill. No way, he says.",
  "It ain't the FBI. Ex-wife. Old girlfriend. Or stupid. That is what brings you down in this business.",
  "It depends. I'm sure by now you know I got an informer in my outfit. Cop. Staties, Boston Police Department, I'm not sure. Jesus Christ.",
  "It isn't any of your business, is it, now?",
  "It might not be a bad idea, you know, another city.",
  "It never crossed my mind. Have you got a camera in the back?",
  "It was nice the way you asked the guy which hand he jerked off with. I hope this don't shake Rita up.",
  "It's a boy.",

  "Keep an eye on this one.",
  "Know what I'm saying?",
  "Last I heard he was married to a 12-year-old boy, living on a beach in Thailand. f**king family's dug into the Southie projects like ticks. Three-decker men at best. You, however, grew up on the North Shore, huh? Well, la-di-f**king-da. You were kind of a double kid, I bet, right? One kid with your old man, one kid with your mother. You're upper-middle class during the weeks, then you're hanging in the Southie projects with your daddy, the f**king donkey on the weekends. I got that right? Yup. You have different accents? You did, didn't you, you little f**king snake? You were like different people.",

  "Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.",
  "Like I said, two days ago, my guy damn near found out who Costello's rat is. But he lost him in the streets.",
  "Listen, Bill, I gotta run this in the other room. This computer's getting all frigging blooey on me. Give me two minutes. I'll have you out of here in no time.",
  "Listen, I can't be a friend to you. I'm sorry.",
  "Listen, I need to see you today.",
  "Listen. I got, like... Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.",

  "Look, I don't know, if that thing moves, I'm gonna shoot it. I don't even know what it is. So what's it like having people find themselves in your office all day long? Does it get messy with all those feelings flying around?",
  "Look, I just want my identity back, all right? That's all.",
  "Look, I'm having panic attacks. Other night, I thought I was having a heart attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over. I haven't slept for f**king weeks.",
  "Look, I'm sorry to even... I'm sorry to even show up here like this, you know? I... There's just no one else I could give it to. There's no one else.",
  "Look, he's Costello's rat, all right? I got boxes of tapes! Evidence! Other documents proving it!",
  "Look, we need you to keep your ears open, all right? No bulls**t. I think Costello's got a spy inside the Special Investigation Unit.",
  "Look, you're 70 years old, Frank. I'm just saying, okay? One of your guys is gonna pop you. One of your guys is gonna pop you.",
  "Look... if this is inappropriate, I...",

  "Maybe someday you'll wake the f**k up.",
  "Maybe you can shoot someone and then see me professionally.",
  "Maybe you do. But right now I need you to drop the weapon!",

  "No, no, no. Today.",
  "No, no, no.",
  "No, no, not presently. But I'm working on that.",
  "No, no. Being a cop's not an identity. I want my identity back. Check your computer. Go on. You'll have to excuse my behavior. My only contact in the last six months has been a police shrink.",
  "No, no. No, I know who you are, though. I know. Guys gotta use their service revolver in the course of duty and then they get to come to talk to you about their feelings and whatnot. No, no, I know how it goes. You're a mental health professional.",
  "No, really, there are things you don't even wanna know about.",

  "No. Come with me.",
  "No. No, it's not inappropriate. You're not a patient.",

  "Not exactly.",
  "Not necessarily.",
  "Not paying attention to us. He's a cop.",
  "Not to my guy.",
  "Nothing about new guys? Nothing about Gloucester?",
  "Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward.",
  "Now what you gonna do?",
  "Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son. I knew Myles. He was younger than me, but he was behind me in school. I wanna get these people who did this to him. Would you like to help us? You wanna help catch the people who forced your son to do a robbery and then killed him?",
  "Now, what the f**k did you just f**king say?",
  "Now, why would you have to remind me of that? Would I be any good at what I do if I didn't f**king already know that? Frank, you gotta trust me. All right? Just trust me, Frank.",
  "Now, why would you have to remind me of that? Would I...? Would I be any good at what I do if I didn't f**king already know that? Frank, you gotta trust me. I can get the rat. You just gotta let me do it my way, Frank. Just let me do it. Let me do what I do.",
  "Now, you also do probation work, right?",
  "Of course I know how to spot a cop.",
  "Of course I talk to the FBI.",

  "Oh, no, my friends are still coming. So we'll just... I'll just see you for lunch instead tomorrow.",
  "Oh, sorry. How'd he go?",
  "Oh, thanks. Thanks.",
  "Oh, that's the movers.",
  "Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all frigging crazy on that floor. I'm one more up.",
  "Oh, who the f**k are you?",
  "Oh, yeah? Yeah. That's kind of like a gold star around here, huh?",
  "Oh, yeah?",
  "Oh, you're a f**king genius. Who forged your transcript, dickhead?",
  "Okay, Francis.",
  "Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them.",
  "Okay, listen, I went to UMass. I wasn't insulting you.",
  "Okay, then just say that.",
  "Okay. But Colin, I hope I won't have to remind you that if you don't find that cheese-eating rat bastard in your department most likely, it won't be me who suffers for it.",
  "Okay. Cop.",
  "One of the cops he's got on the inside tipped him. Come on. Come on.",
  "One of us had to die. With me it tends to be the other guy.",
  "One of you mugs got a light?",
  "One too many. She got a big mouth.",
  "Only one of us is a cop here, Bill.",
  "Open it.",
  "Open the door. Open... Didn't we already talk about this? This is my job.",

  "Pencils. Begin.",
  "Perfect.",
  "Perfect.",
  "Pick a place like this where any cop could see you. Jesus.",
  "Piece of s**t.",
  "Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some f**king cop prick like Queenan to pull you out of the staties and send you after me. I just can't know. I don't know what they do in that particular department, anyway.",
  "Police confirm the body of the man found dead in the Fenway marshes yesterday is that of Timothy Delahunt, an undercover policeman for the city of Boston. This was the scene yesterday when Delahunt's body was found in the marshes near the Fenway. As for who did this or why that's something police are working on right now.",
  "Problem?",
  "Proceed.",
  "Put Colin on the phone right now.",
  "Put the forms in there.",
  "Put the gun down, all right?",
  "Put your weapon on the deck and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!",
  "Queenan had a funeral to go to. This is my shift. Calm down.",
  "Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.",
  "Queenan's compartmentalizing everything in SIU which is the right thing. I don't trust half the troopers out there anymore. Bottom line we think we might have a problem. We think Costello's got a rat in the state police.",
  "Queenan's guy. He called when he found out Queenan died. I'm running him.",
  "Remember I told you that we were… She was gonna move in?",
  "Right now. Collie laying low is not what I do.",
  "SIU. What a country.",

  "Search me for what?",
  "Search randomly for calls made from the area.",
  "See anything you like, Col?",
  "See this guy? You see this guy? This guy don't want you to have the money. Because he wants to come back there and squash your head.",
  "See you later.",
  "She ignored us so she must be a cop.",
  "She moved in.",
  "She wasn't.",
  "She's on her way out.",
  "She's probably the f**king police commissioner.",
  "Shoot this f**king prick.",
  "Shoot this motherf**ker! Would you f**king shoot!",
  "Should I?",
  "Show me your arm. Flip it.",
  "Shut the f**k up!",
  "Shut the f**k up!",
  "Shut up! Work with the tech guys to unlock those files.",
  "Shut up.",
  "Shut your f**king mouth. Come on, get up!",
  "Sir, what do you want from me?",
  "Sir, yes, sir!",
  "Smart-mouth. Too bad. If you'll indulge me... Now what?",
  "So do they all come in here and cry, your cops?",
  "So do you know why Queenan went into that building?",
  "So earn it. I'm getting the feeling we got a cop in my crew.",
  "So get rid of them.",
  "So he never...? I mean, never?",
  "So it is you. Well, thank God you're all right. We were very worried.",
  "So now you're gonna f**k with me? So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh?",
  "So tell anybody up at Deerfield. Before you got kicked out for whaling on a gym teacher with a chair. You had an uncle met his demise like that? I got a question. How f**ked up are you?",

  "Sure. Sure, Will. You, William. What would you do?",
  "Sure.",
  "Swear on your mother's grave you're still not a cop?",

  "And by organized crime in this city, you know who we mean. That's Jackie Costigan. That's an old picture. Jackie met his demise. Last known photograph.",
  "Costello uses three key guys. That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho, lives in Brockton with his mother. She's straight out of Going My Way. Delahunt, muscle. French, the number one. But of course, the rock star, you-know-who. We've done a briefing book, so read up. I want all ideas so I can pass them off as my own. Work hard, you'll rise fast. You're in the best possible position in the department. Let's go to work.",
  "Three o'clock. Where Queenan died. You keep your cell on.",
  "Time is 10:46.",
  "To Jackie.",
  "To you, O Lord, we commend the soul of Alphonsus, your servant. In the sight of this world, he is now dead. Forgive whatever sins he committed through human weakness.",
  "Too bad. Your mother worked all goddamn day. We'll just have to sit down without you and your friends.",
  "Trying to prove something to the family?",
  "Turn the f**king camera off. Give it to me. He doesn't know what the f**king lawyer looks like. Whose briefcase is this? All right.",
  "Twice.",
  "Two days later I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me. Years ago, we had the Church. That was only a way of saying we had each other.",
  "Two days later What license? I don't see none.",
  "Two pills? Why don't you just give me a bottle of Scotch and a handgun to blow my f**king head off?",
  "Uncle Jack.",
  "Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville. He got popped by Nicastro in '95. We found his body out by the airport.",
  "Undercover?",
  "Uniform clipped him for suspended license. However, he's a subject of an open investigation...",
  "Use their weapons? Let me tell you something. They signed up to use their weapons. Most of them, all right. But they watch enough TV so they know they have to weep after they use their weapons. There is no one more full of s**t than a cop. Except for a cop on TV.",
  "Vin, don't make me have to come down here again for this.",
  "Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread, couple half-gallons of milk. Do you like bologna and cheese? Give him some cold cuts. Throw some mayo in You like comic books? You do good in school?",
  "Wait. There's still one phone up.",
  "Wait. You are trouble.",
  "Wake the f**k up.",
  "Want a French doughnut?",
  "Was your meal okay?",
  "Watch what happens this bullet would go right through your f**king head!",
  "Watch what happens!",
  "Watch your f**king back.",
  "Watch your f**king mouth.",
  "Wave to your girlfriend, honey.",
  "We all are. Act accordingly.",
  "We are all convinced that Costello has at least one mole inside the Special Investigations Unit. You will investigate everybody and anybody.",
  "We can't get a visual. Want us to get out? We gotta get on foot if you want me to get up on this thing.",
  "We got a cop in my crew.",
  "We had two hours' notice. Two hours. f**k you think this is, NASA?",
  "We have a blind spot.",
  "We have a question. Do you wanna be a cop, or do you wanna appear to be a cop? It's an honest question. Lot of guys want to appear to be cops. Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.",
  "We have to do it by phone. I won't do it if I have to wear a wire. No wires. Understand? You don't know what this is like.",
  "We looked at all possible candidates. You have an immaculate record. Some people don't trust a guy with an immaculate record. I do. I have an immaculate record.",
  "We should have a few more meetings before we even talk about prescriptions.",
  "We won't be working together, that is, directly. You'll be working for Captain Ellerby, but I like to see everybody. You're a worker. You rise fast.",
  "We'd miss less if you made your informants available to us and the Bureau.",
  "We're cops, all right? This isn't somewhere.",
  "We're getting a warrant. Can't get an address off him. He paged his lawyer but the lawyer hasn't called back yet.",
  "We're not even supposed to be doing this s**t this close to Worcester. This side of Worcester.",
  "We're not here to solve the case of the missing scumbag. We're here to nail Costello.",
  "Welcome to the neighborhood.",
  "Well, I expect that some people do it to keep things on an even keel.",
  "Well, I knew his father. I liked his Uncle Jackie better.",
  "Well, I thought she was.",
  "Well, I thought you were. So now you gotta buy me dinner.",
  "Well, I'm going home, all right? He's playing with his new guys. See you later, all right?",
  "Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?",
  "Well, I'm the guy that tells you there are guys you can hit and there's guys you can't. Now, that's not quite a guy you can't hit but it's almost a guy you can't hit. So I'm gonna make a f**king ruling on this right now: You don't f**king hit him. You understand?",
  "Well, a better question, is why the f**k were your guys following him?",
  "Well, boss told me to go home.",
  "Well, did he get a look at the guy?",
  "Well, families are always rising or falling in America, am I right?",
  "Well, nothing. I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.",
  "Well, she got reliable.",
  "Well, that's not exactly a dream job for a cop.",
  "Well, these days who's reliable?",
  "Well, you do know what a bookie does, don't you?",
  "Were you not in the f**king car?",
  "What about the baby?",
  "What about this guy?",
  "What about you?",
  "What about your wife, Arnold?",
  "What are you doing here? Come here.",
  "What are you drinking?",
  "What are you gonna do about Costello's rat in this building?",
  "What are you looking at? Forget it. Your father was a janitor, his son's only a cop.",
  "What are you saying?",
  "What arm? What f**king arm?",
  "What back?",
  "What can't you believe?",
  "What did I just put myself through? I'm out of here.",
  "What did you do with the real microprocessors, Frank?",
  "What did you say?",
  "What do you expect coming in here?",
  "What do you expect? Everybody knows you've been assigned here to find Costello's rat. They want to find the leak as much as you do.",
  "What do you got for me?",
  "What do you mean, off the building?",
  "What do you mean, off the roof?",
  "What do you think? Have you made statements or phone calls I need to be made aware of?",
  "What do you want?",
  "What happened to Jimmy Pappas?",
  "What happened?",
  "What is it?",
  "What is this, a citizen's arrest? Blow me, all right?",
  "What the f**k did you just say about the FBI?",
  "What the f**k do you do?",
  "What the f**k do you want from me? Was I there or was I not there?",
  "What the f**k is going on?",
  "What the f**k is it with you and your phone, huh?",
  "What the f**k you doing?",
  "What the f**k...?",
  "What the f**k? f**k.",
  "What was his name, the departed?",
  "What would you do if he was standing right there and he saw us?",
  "What you got, staff sergeant?",
  "What you see there for service is what you're gonna get.",
  "What's going on? I came to meet you.",
  "What's got you all hot and bothered?",
  "What's he doing, setting up IRAs?",
  "What's that say about what you do?",
  "What's that?",
  "What's the difference?",
  "What's the matter, smart-ass, you don't know any f**king Shakespeare?",
  "What's this I hear from Stephanie about you becoming a policeman?",
  "What's this?",
  "What's this?",
  "What's wrong with this f**king country? Everybody hates everybody!",
  "What, are you f**king delivering cannolis or something?",
  "What, so you can get the parade, huh? The bagpipes and bulls**t? f**k you! f**k you, I'm f**king arresting you!",
  "What, you wanna hear about the showers?",
  "What, you want me to say it? I'm not a cop, all right? I'm your f**king cousin.",
  "What? Like a son? To you? Is that what this is about?",
  "Whatever may be going on in that very f**king poor very limited brain of yours, I am not gonna hurt you, all right?",
  "Whatever you have to say think about it real hard, all right? If you still wanna tell me, you tell me in two weeks, okay?",
  "Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. But you weren't at f**king home. So where the f**k were you?",
  "When are you gonna take Costello? What's wrong with taking him on any one of the million felonies that you've seen him do or I've seen him do? I mean, he murdered somebody, right? The guy f**king murders somebody and you don't f**king take him! What are you waiting for? Do you want him to chop me up and feed me to the poor? That what you want?",
  "When my mother dies, we don't have any more connection.",
  "When we're working together just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.",
  "When you decide to be something, you can be it. That's what they don't tell you in the Church. When I was your age, they would say we could become cops or criminals. Today what I'm saying to you is this: When you're facing a loaded gun... what's the difference? That's my boy.",
  "When's the last time you checked?",
  "Where are you? We've been trying to reach you. We found the rat. Listen, we're gonna take him out. Lookit: The address is 314 Washington Street. You got it? All right, we'll see you there.",
  "Where the f**k are you going?",
  "Where the hell's Frank?",
  "Where were you?",
  "Where's Dignam? I told you to bring Dignam!",
  "Where's your boy?",
  "Where's your f**king boy?",
  "Where's your license?",
  "Who are you?",
  "Who are you?",
  "Who didn't show up today is the rat.",
  "Who knows what's easy? Colin, I know you'll take care of business.",
  "Who said he had a problem?",
  "Who said that?",
  "Who says I wanna see you again?",
  "Who told you I had delicate sensibilities? I just don't like it, sarge. Don't feel right.",
  "Who's the lawyer?",
  "Who's the lead detective? Good. He's a lox.",
  "Who's this?",
  "Whoop-de-f**king-do.",
  "Why am I not f**king surprised? All right, lookit, I gotta tell you You're getting reassigned. I know. How the f**k do you know that? Where'd they put you?",
  "Why are you pretending to be a cop?",
  "Why did they turn their phones off?",
  "Why did you use my phone?",
  "Why do we have a blind spot?",
  "Why do you do it, then? Some people do get better. Fair enough. Sometimes I want people to forget their personal bulls**t and do their jobs.",
  "Why do you think he never gets busted? Costello's a protected FBI informant. He'll trade you out.",
  "Why don't we meet? Let me buy you an ice cream.",
  "Why is the last patient of the day always the hardest one?",
  "Why not? You do.",
  "Why shouldn't I get on a f**king plane, huh? Meet up? You actually want me dead? Look, there is a rat in your unit. That is a fact, all right? Where's Queenan?",
  "Why, does that make you uncomfortable?",
  "Why? Do you?",
  "Will you shut up? We are building a case and it takes time. You know that.",
  "With everybody looking up their own ass and you looking for yourself I put my money on nobody finds nothing.",
  "Without asking for too many details, do you have anyone in with Costello now?",
  "Won't happen again, Mr. C.",
  "World needs plenty of bartenders. Two weeks with pay.",
  "Would you shoot this f**king prick!",
  "Would you shut the f**k up for five seconds, huh?",
  "Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?",
  "Wow.",
  "Yeah I know.",
  "Yeah, I am. I'm actually going to law school also.",
  "Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat f**ks like you, okay? I don't like them.",
  "Yeah, I got that.",
  "Yeah, I gotcha.",
  "Yeah, I know, I'm kind of getting that feeling too.",
  "Yeah, I know. I'm kind of getting that feeling too.",
  "Yeah, I know.",
  "Yeah, I know.",
  "Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene, but knock yourself out.",
  "Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas.",
  "Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?",
  "Yeah, come on, man. You have some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen. Come on. You want some coke? There it is. Don't move till you're numb. Come on. Get inside.",
  "Yeah, company.",
  "Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.",
  "Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein.",
  "Yeah, he must be our guy.",
  "Yeah, he said that.",
  "Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who-Didn't-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?",

  "Yeah, that Stephanie.",
  "Yeah, that was his problem.",
  "Yeah, that's my cousin.",
  "Yeah, that's right, fancy.",
  "Yeah, that's true. I said something f**king true. I want some f**king pills and you're gonna close my file?",
  "Yeah, they don't run Harvard at night, last time I checked.",
  "Yeah, they got this but they don't got duck I'orange.",
  "Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan. I want constant surveillance on Captain Queenan, starting right now. Good. Thank you.",
  "Yeah, well, one usually follows the other.",
  "Yeah, what if they took one off and they put another one on? Load.",
  "Yeah, who wants to know?",
  "Yeah, yeah.",
  "Yeah, you lie. You lie. Is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally or, what, just for the f**k of it?",
  "Yeah, you still wanna stay?",
  "Yeah. Everybody's f**king numbers. Is there something that you just wanna go ahead and ask me? Because I'll give you the f**king answer, all right? Frank, look at me. Look at me. I'm not the f**king rat. Okay? I'm not the f**king rat.",
  "Yeah. Hey, can I lookit?",
  "Yeah. How long you been with this guy?",
  "Yeah. I'm not sitting here without a tetanus shot.",
  "Yeah. Sure.",
  "Yeah. We were classmates in the academy together.",
  "Yeah. Yeah, I do.",
  "Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.",
  "Yeah. Yeah. Well, I can't even tell you the debt... I just want you to know I'll be recommending you for the Medal of Merit.",
  "Yeah. You got a tail. Two cars. Not very subtle. They're not gonna be subtle from now on. That's what I've been trying to say.",
  "Yeah? Do you know he's dead?",
  "Yeah? Is it enough to commit suicide?",
  "Yeah? So?",
  "Yeah? What about the FBI?",
  "Yes, sir, I have an idea...",
  "Yes. And what he's doing. Get rid of the tail, get Special Ops on standby. We'll take this prick tonight.",
  "Yes. Otherwise it's...",
  "Yes. Yes, I do.",
  "Yes. Yes, yes.",
  "You Johhny Sullivan's kid?",
  "You a psychiatrist?",
  "You always have to question everything, don't you?",
  "You are! Yes.",
  "You better get organized, quick.",
  "You called this number on a dead guy's phone.",
  "You can get out of here. I'm using a new crew tonight. New guys.",
  "You can go in there now.",
  "You can leave!",
  "You can sit. So. Do you know what we do here? My section?",
  "You didn't come here to talk, all right? You came here to get arrested.",
  "You don't have any cats.",
  "You don't have much family.",
  "You don't know the half of it. I'll arrest you right now.",
  "You don't see any pictures of where I came from. Look, I respect who you are just, you know, not in the living room. We might have company.",
  "You earned it. No more pencils, no more books.",

  "You have a boss that has a laryngectomy?",
  "You have to move in with your boyfriend?",
  "You heard nothing about drugs?",
  "You ignored us, you're a cop. We're guessing who cops are. You know, most good-looking women are cops.",
  "You keep telling me I'm your friend. You don't even know my f**king name.",
  "You know something, they just do not stop having the Mafia in Providence. And this can cause me a lot of problems. Those guys you tuned up, they're connected down Providence. What they're gonna do is come back with some guys and kill you. Which, sure as you're born, they will do. Unless I stop them. Do you want me to stop them?",
  "You know that guy?",
  "You know what I like about restaurants?",
  "You know what I thought today?",
  "You know what you... You know what you usually say at these moments.",
  "You know what, I thought I was the liar.",
  "You know where he's going?",
  "You know who I am. You know who I am.",
  "You know who I am.",
  "You know, after my mother passed and everything. In your line of work, if I gave you like, what, say, 10,000, what could I get back?",
  "You know, and too damn bad if you don't like my initial clinical reaction.",
  "You know, direct contact with your guys would have its advantages.",
  "You know, past days, situation like this, I kill everybody. Everybody who works for me.",
  "You learn a lot watching things eat. There's a boat coming up Gloucester. French will give you all the details. Don't forget.",
  "You live with your grandmother?",
  "You making a house call?",
  "You met my friend Mr. French the other night.",
  "You my attorney?",
  "You need to call your mother... tell her you're not gonna be home for supper.",
  "You ready?",
  "You remember that. What a night.",
  "You said there is one, all right? I base most of what I do on the idea that you're pretty good at what you do.",
  "You see, that's my point, you know? You accuse me once, I put up with it. You accuse me twice I quit. You pressure me to fear for my life and I will put a f**king bullet in your head as if you were anybody else. Okay?",
  "You seem quite happy with that result.",
  "You serious?",
  "You should see your face.",
  "You sit there with a mass murderer. A mass murderer. Your heart rate is jacked. And your hand steady. That's one thing I figured out about myself in prison. My hand does not shake. Ever.",
  "You stupid f**king hard-on! You f**ked this whole thing up! What the f**k did you do, you c**ksucker? Let go of me! I'm gonna rip your f**king arm off and shove it up your f**king ass!",
  "You think he's dead already?",
  "You understand that, Bill? No one knows you.",
  "You wanna serve the Commonwealth, this is your chance. We need you, pal. You've already pretended to be a Costigan from South Boston.",
  "You want the truth? Valium.",
  "You were followed.",
  "You'll do enough jail time to convince anyone this is no setup. You'll be on probation, see a court-ordered shrink the whole nine yards.",
  "You're a cop.",
  "You're an FBI informant? Are you f**king kidding me?",
  "You're bad. You corrupt f**k, man. You must be my cousin.",
  "You're f**king late! Get in the van!",
  "You're f**king ridiculous.",
  "You're gonna give me s**t? It wasn't for no reason, Frank. He reached into his coat. I don't know if he's a bookie or what he's doing.",
  "You're lying to me.",
  "You're s**tting me.",
  "You're telling me, sonny boy.",
  "You're tired and you don't give a s**t. It's not supernatural.",
  "Your best? What do you think we're in, the f**king haberdashery business?",
  "Your guys should not have done that.",
  "Your mother will be proud. All right, thanks, Pop.",
  "Your old man was a f**king hump from Southie. Baggage handler at the airport, right? Family's all criminals except for the old man, huh?",
  "c**ksucker! I don't have to f**king explain anything to anybody! I can f**king investigate anybody I want to!",
  "c**ksuckers. Motherf**king s**t! Motherf**king! Back the f**k up!",
  "f**k it.",

  "f**king prick.",

  "f**king rats. It's wearing me thin.",
  "f**king s**t. Looks like Queenan's meeting with all of them.",
  "f**king...!",
  "hanging your life radically. Change anything. Right? Change everything. Right?",

  "s**t!",

  'Then I see her dancing at the wedding with you-know-who. I say, "Why don\'t you go to Parents Without Partners?" He goes, "Ma, they\'re all losers at the Parents Without Partners," so... So I say to him, "Princess Carolina of Monaco..."',
